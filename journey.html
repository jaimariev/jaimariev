      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>The problem that we came up with was not our initial idea, but it was the one we believed was most innovative and that had most potential. Our Idea was to create an application that would make the interactions between a parent and school/teacher more efficient and practical. We derived our inspiration for the application from conversations with parents, and also demos of existing systems by those very same parents. After our research we saw many glaring needs in systems currently in place by elementary schools. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="build">
      <h2>How we decided what to build</h2>
      <p>After coming to a consensus as a group about the problem we wanted to solve, we were still left with the task of coming up with a solution to that very problem. For one we were very limited by a roughly 4 week timeframe that was set to us by the school; nevertheless, we had to be realistic and think critically about what could be done in such a short amount of time. That led us to prioritize our MVP(minimum viable product). Our MVP was to be an application that allowed parents to see their children’s grades, attendance, behavior, fees, and forms. We also found it crucial that we get online form signature and fee payment integrated because those two features were what truly separated us from current systems.</p>

    <div id="tech">
      <h2>Technical Requirements</h2>
      <p>Our technology stack consisted of a multitude of languages, libraries, and frameworks in order to accomplish the goal that we set for ourselves. On the backend we built the application with python and django as the framework, and it was designed in a way so that the data visualization and display was done through an api by an external front end Framework. The API was a Restful Api, and the front end framework that pulled in the data was Backbone.js.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="techChallenge">
      <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
      <p>Admittingly many technical challenges arose during that development of the application that we did not foresee or prepare for. For one, an issue that took up a significant portion of our time, was the retrieval and display of nested data on the front end. Our API was designed in such a way that required nested data to have two or more calls, and it caused a headache for the front end developers. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="nonTech">
      <h2>Non-Technical Challenges</h2>
      <p>Aside from the technical challenges that we had, we also had many challenges that we had that were non-technical. Retrospectively, one issue that would be addressed in a better way would be the communication with members of the development team. More often than not, there were many instances in which members were not on the same page about who was working on what. That caused stagnation in our project because too much time was spent resolving code conflicts that could have been avoided with better communication.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="learn">
      <h2>What we learned along the way</h2>
      <p>After looking back at the MVP stage of our project, it is undeniable that many things were learned from the experience. One of the most important things that was learned, is the fact that we all as whole should be more realistic when it comes to time management. The time required to complete portions of the project were vastly underestimated, and that left us scrambling to get things done when our deadline approached.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="current">
      <h2>Current Product</h2>
      <p>In it’s current form, our final product is not what we initially hoped it would be; however, we are very proud of what we accomplished in the timeframe that was given to us. For one we got most of the basic features we planned out, and one of the crucial features we hoped to have. The feature we are most proud of is the online form signature feature for the parent’s, and having that itself could help millions of parents across the country.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="next">
      <h2>What's Next?</h2>
      <p>What is next for Parent Teacher Connection? Well we plan to integrate our second crucial mvp feature which was the online fee payment for parents. After that, we would love to integrate features such as instant messaging, online tutoring scheduling, a more robust Teacher interface, and advanced analytics system for parents to see data on their children. We are very proud of what we have made, and are excited about it’s possibilities.</p><br/><br/>
