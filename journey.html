    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>The problem that we came up with was not our initial idea, but it was the one we believed was most innovative and that had most potential. Our Idea was to create an application that would make the interactions between a parent and school/teacher more efficient and practical. We derived our inspiration for the application from conversations with parents, and also demos of existing systems by those very same parents. After our research we saw many glaring needs in systems currently in place by elementary schools. </p>

    <h2>How we decided what to build</h2>
    <p>After coming to a consensus as a group about the problem we wanted to solve, we were still left with the task of coming up with a solution to that very problem. For one we were very limited by a roughly 4 week timeframe that was set to us by the school; nevertheless, we had to be realistic and think critically about what could be done in such a short amount of time. That led us to prioritize our MVP(minimum viable product). Our MVP was to be an application that allowed parents to see their childrenâ€™s grades, attendance, behavior, fees, and forms. We also found it crucial that we get online form signature and fee payment integrated because those two features were what truly separated us from current systems.</p>

    <h2>Technical Requirements</h2>
    <p>Our technology stack consisted of a multitude of languages, libraries, and frameworks in order to accomplish the goal that we set for ourselves. On the backend we built the application with python and django as the framework, and it was designed in a way so that the data visualization and display was done through an api by an external front end Framework. The API was a Restful Api, and the front end framework that pulled in the data was Backbone.js.</p>

  <div id="techChallenge">
    <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
    <p>Admittingly many technical challenges arose during that development of the application that we did not foresee or prepare for. For one, an issue that took up a significant portion of our time, was the retrieval and display of nested data on the front end. Our API was designed in such a way that required nested data to have two or more calls, and it caused a headache for the front end developers. </p>
